Because I always forget how to get this to work:

To download the latest when it doesn't exist, from the home directory:
git clone https://github.com/nickca/dotfiles

Then make sure my commonly used SSH identity is installed

Then run this:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:nickca/dotfiles.git

Have I mentioned that I fucking hate GIT? Seriously, there is no need to make it this fucking obtuse.

To commit changes:
git commit -a -m "Message goes here"
git push origin

Have I mentioned that GIT fucking sucks a dick? Why do I even use it?

To sync changes:
git pull

To add a new file after creating it:
git add filename

Notes about installing the required zsh stuff are in zshrc
Notes about installing powerline for VIM are in gvimrc
